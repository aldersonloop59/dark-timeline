## Explore the timeline

Explore the timeline
The best way by far to explore the timeline is with [Lucidchart viewer](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/a5e1f8d9-ff87-4adb-ab39-b1ce42fc1146/Qnmp0zdBgMJ-). It renders the image in high definition and you can zoom and pan smoothly. Besides, if I made any changes you will see at the moment.

The only problem is that, in mobile, Lucidchart will tell you to download and log in the app or you will see a blurry version of the timeline. For that, I've created an alternative. [Check this link](https://aldersonloop59.github.io/dark-timeline/index.html)!
